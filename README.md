===========

The project proposes a middleware for simplifying the development and deployment of 
body sensor network (BSN) solutions as well as their integration in ambient sensing 
environments. The middleware handles a variety of sensors and copes with complexity
of heterogeneous and changing sensor constellations; properties of BSNs that become
more and more apparent. Information from sensors are collected and made available 
for various applications consistently.
